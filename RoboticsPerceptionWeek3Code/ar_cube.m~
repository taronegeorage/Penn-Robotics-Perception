function [proj_points, t, R] = ar_cube(H,render_points,K)
%% ar_cube
% Estimate your position and orientation with respect to a set of 4 points on the ground
% Inputs:
%    H - the computed homography from the corners in the image
%    render_points - size (N x 3) matrix of world points to project
%    K - size (3 x 3) calibration matrix for the camera
% Outputs: 
%    proj_points - size (N x 2) matrix of the projected points in pixel
%      coordinates
%    t - size (3 x 1) vector of the translation of the transformation
%    R - size (3 x 3) matrix of the rotation of the transformation
% Written by Stephen Phillips for the Coursera Robotics:Perception course
